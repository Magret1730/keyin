# QAP 2 – SQL Practice with PostgreSQL

This repository is the starting point for **QAP 2** in your Databases course. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to design, populate, and query relational databases using raw SQL in PostgreSQL.

For complete instructions, grading criteria, and examples, refer to the [assignment sheet](https://menglishca.github.io/keyin-course-notes/databases/qaps/qap-2/).

## Project Structure

You’ll complete two separate database problems. Use the following folder structure in your repository:

```
(root)
├── problem-1/
│   └── queries.sql    # SQL for Problem 1
│
└── problem-2/
└── queries.sql    # SQL for Problem 2
```

You **may use this structure** if you'd like, or feel free to organize your SQL queries differently. As long as they're organized in some fashion and in the repo, it's perfect!

## Assignment Summary

You will be writing raw SQL to:

- Create tables with correct columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and appropriate data types
- Insert sample data into your tables
- Write a series of `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements based on prompts in the assignment sheet
- Copy your final, working SQL statements into the appropriate `.sql` files in this repo

Do **not** submit SQL dump files or screenshots, just the `.sql` files with your code.

## How to Work

- It's recommended you use `pgAdmin` to test your work
- Write and test your queries in the interface
- Once they are working correctly, copy them into your `.sql` file for submission

## Git Guidelines

- Commit regularly with clear, meaningful commit messages
- Make sure your GitHub name and email are properly configured
- Do not commit `.DS_Store`, `.env`, or exported database files

## How to Submit

- Push your completed work to your GitHub repository
- Submit your GitHub repository link on Teams under the QAP 2 assignment
- Submissions are subject to Keyin’s late policy, which can be found [here](https://keyincollege289.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/FullstackJavascript-SD13May.2025-Aug.2025/EQsdYpI0N1RPsETRsktEqmkBTDvs1QzdvJT5cmDCQoSHWw?e=ZT4ph9)

## Final Notes

- Review the full [assignment sheet](https://menglishca.github.io/keyin-course-notes/databases/qaps/qap-2/) for all requirements and grading criteria
- Write clean, readable SQL
- Don’t wait until the last minute, please reach out if you need help
