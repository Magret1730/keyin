        <h3>Geographical Information</h3>
        <p>
          The province consists of two sections, the island of Newfoundland, and
          the mainland portion of Labrador. The most easterly Canadian province,
          the island is situated at the mouth of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The
          province lies between the 46th and 61st parallels.

        <h3>Exploration History</h3>
        <p>
          The first European contact with North America was that of the medieval
          Norse settlers arriving via Greenland. For several years after AD 1000
          they lived in a village on the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula,
          known today as L'Anse aux Meadows. Remnants and artifacts of the
          occupation can still be seen at L'Anse aux Meadows, now a UNESCO World
          Heritage Site. The island was inhabited by the Beothuk (known as
          skrælingjar in Greenlandic Norse) and later by Mi'kmaq.
        </p>
 
        <p>
          From the late 15th Century, European explorers like John Cabot, João
          Fernandes Lavrador, Gaspar Corte-Real, Jacques Cartier and others
          began exploration.
        </p>
 
        <p>
          John Cabot (1450-1499), commissioned by King Henry VII of England,
          landed on the North East coast of North America in 1497. The exact
          location of his landing is unknown but the 500th anniversary of his
          landing was commemorated in Bonavista. The 1497 voyage has generated
          much debate among historians, with various points in Newfoundland, and
          Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, most often identified as the likely
          landing place.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Although it was not declared the provincial flower of Newfoundland and
          Labrador until 1954, this strange plant appeared on the Newfoundland
          penny during the late 1880s. The

            >pitcher plant</a
          >
          is found primarily in bogs and marshland throughout the province. It
          has a large wine-red flower and hollow pitcher-shaped leaves are
          attached to the base of the stem. An insectivorous plant, it feeds off
          insects that become trapped inside when the leaves fill with water.

          Designated as the provincial tree in November 1993, it is also known
          as the bog spruce. Although dark bluish-green in color, it is called
          the "black" spruce to distinguish it from other types of spruce trees.
          An evergreen coniferous tree, it is tolerant of nutrient-deficient
          soils, growing primarily in areas that have poor drainage. The

          >
          has officially been the provincial bird of Newfoundland and Labrador
          since 1991. It is a member of the auk family. The puffin is also
          called the sea parrot because of its multi-colored beak. Marine birds
          that inhabit cliffs, puffins can dive 50 meters underwater in search
          of food. Their diet consists mostly of small fish such as caplin and
          herring. Their wingspan is approximately 55 cm., and they can fly up
          to 80 km. per hour. They live approximately 25 years, usually mate for
          life, and produce one egg per year. Witless Bay, Newfoundland, is home
          to the largest puffin colony in North America.

        </h3>
        <p>
          A mineral discovered in northern Labrador, it was first described by
          Moravian missionaries in the late 18th century and brought to Europe.
          It is prized for its beautiful shifting iridescent colors of blue,
          green, grey and bronze. Found largely in the Nain area of Labrador, it
          is being mined at Ten Mile Bay by the Labrador Inuit Association.

          The provincial tartan was developed in 1955 by Sam Wilansky, a
          clothing store owner in St. John's. The tartan is predominantly green
          with gold, white, brown and red bands of color. He chose most of the
